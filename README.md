# Image Scrambling and Recovery Analysis

## Description
This project explores image processing techniques using NumPy and Matplotlib in Python. It demonstrates the process of scrambling an image by shuffling its rows and columns, and then recovering the original image through matrix operations. The project includes visualizations of the original, scrambled, and recovered images, providing insights into matrix transformations and their applications in image processing.

### Key Features:
- Image loading and manipulation using NumPy and PIL
- Matrix operations for row and column scrambling
- Visualization of image transformations
- Demonstration of image recovery through inverse matrix operations

This notebook serves as an educational tool for understanding basic concepts in linear algebra and their practical applications in digital image processing.
